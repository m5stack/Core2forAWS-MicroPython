#   AWS IoT connectivity example in MicroPython for the M5Stack Core2 for AWS IoT Kit
#   This example uses the ESP32 to connect to AWS IoT Core using the attached ATECC608
#   Trust&GO secure element for establishing a secure TLS connection.
#
#   Prerequisite â€” This example assumes you have completed the AWS IoT Kit tutorials
#   1) Getting Started
#   2) Cloud Connected Blinky / Hello World
#
#   The examples requires the thing (device) to be registered with AWS IoT with the 
#   policy included in the tutorials. Your publish topic and subscribe topics must
#   use the <<CLIENT_ID>>/ prefix, where the client Id is the unique serial number of
#   the device's secure element.
#
#   TO RUN THIS EXAMPLE:
#   Update the Wi-Fi credentials with the SSID and password for a 2.4GHz network.
#   Paste in the AWS IoT MQTT broker endpoint address in the spave below. There should
#   not be a protocol (e.g. "mqtt://") prefix or a trailing "/" at the end.
